    <string name="donate_paypal_giving_fund_donation_terms_of_service">PayPal covers all transaction costs for donations made on this site, ensuring that 100%% of each gift made is available to charity. Your donation will be made to PayPal Giving Fund, an IRS&#8208;registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit (Federal Tax ID: 45&#8208;0931286). PayPal Giving Fund is the charity of record and will provide the donation receipt for your gift. All charities listed on this site are enrolled with PayPal Giving Fund, but donors who give on certain partner websites, or who donated on this site between December 23, 2016 and April 17, 2017 may also have had the ability to select charities not yet enrolled with the PayPal Giving Fund. All unenrolled charities listed on any PayPal Giving Fund site or directory are verified tax-exempt organizations that have not been identified by any relevant
        authority as being subject to sanctions. Charities enrolled with PayPal Giving Fund will typically receive funds in their PayPal accounts within 15 to 45 days after PayPal Giving Fund’s receipt of a donation. Charities not enrolled with PayPal Giving Fund will be additionally vetted and if eligible, will receive funds via other means, such as a check, which takes longer than grants made to enrolled charities. PayPal Giving Fund holds all donations in a non-interest bearing account. PayPal Giving Fund retains ultimate discretion over all donations it receives and, in limited cases, may be required to redirect funds when a charity does not meet legal or other eligibility requirements. For more information, please see &lt;a href=&quot;%1$s&quot;&gt;PayPal Giving Fund’s Nonprofit Certification Policy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;%2$s&quot;&gt;Donation Delivery Policy&lt;/a&gt;.</string>
